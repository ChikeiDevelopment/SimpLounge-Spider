# webfront but its not really front its actually kind of more back end but I dont know why I chose to call it webFRONT i was super tired in the progress of the making of this and I wanted to die really bad because life wasnt giving me lemons at the time of creation but now I know how to vue which is really cool and i will tell all my friends about my amazing vue experience i wonder if vue can touch me because if it can i would love it to touch my pp very gently and feel it it sounds so mazing vue is love vue is life! Also... fuck ponies
